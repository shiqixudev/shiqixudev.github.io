I am currently an imaging algorithm scientist at Zeiss in California. My role is to design and develop scalable, deep learning-enabled algorithms for high-resolution volumetric image reconstruction.

Before joining Zeiss, I obtained my Ph.D. from Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. Roarke Horstmeyer](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/people/roarke-horstmeyer). During this time, I developed computational algorithms for novel sensor arrays to image moving objects with gigapixel resolution. I also hold an M.S. degree from Washington University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) on compressive sensing, and [Prof. Quing Zhu](https://opticalultrasoundimaging.wustl.edu/) on medical imaging analysis for portable bedside devices.

**Research Interests**
I am interested in creating computational imaging technologies to help understand and digitize the world.

**Research Expertises**
- Volumetric image reconstruction
- High resolution optical and X-ray imaging system
- Computational photography
- Image processing and analysis (both AI and classic)
